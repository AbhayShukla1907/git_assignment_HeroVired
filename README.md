# CalculatorPlus

CalculatorPlus is a Python application that provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project involves implementing a new feature to calculate the square root of a number.

## Project Steps

## A. Create a Repository:
   1. Created a new repository named `git_assignment_HeroVired` on GitHub.

## B. Create a `dev` Branch and Add Initial Code:
   1. Created and switched to the `dev` branch.
      
## C. Added the initial code to 'calculator.py'.

## D. Merge 'dev' Branch with 'main' Branch and Create a Release: 
   1. Switched to the 'main' branch and merged 'dev'.
   2. Created the v1.0 release on GitHub.
      
## E. Add Collaborator:
   1. Added a classmate as a collaborator via GitHub settings.
      
## F. Implement Square Root Feature:      
   1. Created a new branch 'feature/sqrt'.
   2. Ensured the square root function was correctly implemented and pushed changes.
      
## G. Fix Critical Bug in 'dev' Branch:      
   1. Switched back to the 'dev' branch.
   2. Fixed the divide function to handle division by zero.
   3. Committed and pushed the changes.
      
## H. Keep 'feature/sqrt' Branch Up-to-Date:
   1. Switched to the 'feature/sqrt' branch and merged 'dev'.
   2. Resolved any conflicts, committed, and pushed the changes.
      
## I. Create a Pull Request:
   1. Created a pull request on GitHub to merge feature/sqrt into main.
      
## J. Code Review:
   1. Requested a code review from a team member.
   2. Addressed feedback and made improvements.
      
## K. Merge feature/sqrt into dev Branch:
   1. Once approved, merged 'feature/sqrt' into 'dev'.
   2. Pushed the changes.
      
## l. Final Testing and Release:
   1. Tested the application in the dev branch.
   2. fix issues identified during testing.
   3. Merged 'dev' into 'main'.
   4. Created the v2.0 release on GitHub
      
## M. Conclusion:
   This project successfully added a square root feature and fixed a critical bug in the 
   CalculatorPlus application. The steps followed ensured smooth development, collaboration, 
   and version control.
