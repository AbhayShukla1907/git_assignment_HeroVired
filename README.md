   1. Created and switched to the `dev` branch.
      
## C. Added the initial code to 'calculator.py'.

## D. Merge 'dev' Branch with 'main' Branch and Create a Release: 
   1. Switched to the 'main' branch and merged 'dev'.
   2. Created the v1.0 release on GitHub.
      
## E. Add Collaborator:
   1. Added a classmate as a collaborator via GitHub settings.
      
## F. Implement Square Root Feature:      
   1. Created a new branch 'feature/sqrt'.
   2. Ensured the square root function was correctly implemented and pushed changes.
      
## G. Fix Critical Bug in 'dev' Branch:      
   1. Switched back to the 'dev' branch.
   2. Fixed the divide function to handle division by zero.
   3. Committed and pushed the changes.
      
## H. Keep 'feature/sqrt' Branch Up-to-Date:
   1. Switched to the 'feature/sqrt' branch and merged 'dev'.
   2. Resolved any conflicts, committed, and pushed the changes.
      
## I. Create a Pull Request:
   1. Created a pull request on GitHub to merge feature/sqrt into main.
      
## J. Code Review:
   1. Requested a code review from a team member.
   2. Addressed feedback and made improvements.
      
## K. Merge feature/sqrt into dev Branch:
   1. Once approved, merged 'feature/sqrt' into 'dev'.
   2. Pushed the changes.
      
## l. Final Testing and Release:
   1. Tested the application in the dev branch.
   2. fix issues identified during testing.
   3. Merged 'dev' into 'main'.
   4. Created the v2.0 release on GitHub


      
# Geometry Calculator Project
  This project involves creating a Python program that calculates the area of a circle and a  rectangle. The project demonstrates the use of Git for version control, including branching, stashing, and creating pull requests.
## Project Steps

## 1. Create a New Branch for Circle Area Feature.

## 2. Implement Circle Area Feature and Stash Changes:
   1. Create 'geometry_calculator.py' and add the initial code.
   2. Stage and stash changes.
   3. Verify the working directory is clean.

## 3. Create a New Branch for Rectangle Area Feature.

## 4. Implement Rectangle Area Feature and Stash Changes:
   1. Retrieve stashed changes.
   2. Modify the code to complete the rectangle area feature.
   3. Stage and stash changes.
   4. Verify the working directory is clean.

## 5. Switch Back to Circle Area Branch:
   1. Switch back to the 'feature/circle-area' branch.
   2. Retrieve stashed changes.
   3. Complete the circle area feature.
   4. Stage, commit, and push the changes.

## 6. Switch Back to Rectangle Area Branch:
   1. Switch back to the 'feature/rectangle-area' branch:
   2. Retrieve stashed changes.
   3. Complete the rectangle area feature.
   4. Stage, commit, and push the changes.

## 7. Create Pull Requests:
   1. Push changes to the remote repository (if not already done).
   2. Open your GitHub repository in a web browser.
   3. Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request".
   4. Set the base branch to dev and the compare branch to feature/rectangle-area.
   5. Review the changes and create the pull request with a title and description.

## 8. Review and Merge:
   1. Request a review from team members.
   2. After approval, merge the pull request into the dev branch.
   3. Push the changes to the remote repository.



# Introduction
   This repository demonstrates how to integrate Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle large binary files efficiently. The steps performed include adding, committing, and pushing binary files to the repository and verifying the files on another machine.
## Project Steps

## 1. Install Git LFS.

## 2. Clone the Repository and Initialize Git LFS:
      git clone https://github.com/AbhayShukla1907/git_assignment_HeroVired.git git_assignment_HeroVired
      cd git_assignment_HeroVired
      
## 3. git lfs install.

## 4. Create a Branch for LFS Integration:
   1. Create and switch to a new branch 'lfs'.

## 5. Track Large Binary Files with Git LFS

## 6. Add, Commit, and Push Files:
   1. Add the '.gitattributes' file and commit it.
   2. Add the large binary file.
   3. Push the changes to the remote repository.

## 7. Verify on Another Machine

## M. Conclusion:
   Here's a conclusion based on the assignment guidelines:

"In this assignment, I successfully implemented various features and bug fixes for the CalculatorPlus application, utilizing Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. I also integrated Git LFS to efficiently handle large binary files and demonstrated its usage. Additionally, I worked on a geometry calculator program, employing Git stash to manage multiple features and ensuring clean working directories.

Through this assignment, I have demonstrated my understanding of:

1. Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
2. Feature implementation and bug fixing
3. Git LFS for large file storage
4. Git stash for managing multiple features
